What is React.js?
- React is JS library for building user interfaces. 
- React is a Extremely popular Declarative, component based state-driven js library for building UI. 

- based on component -> component are the building blocks of the UI (buttons, forms, ..etc), we build a complex UI by building and
                        combining multiple components.
-  we describe how components look and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX
- Declarative  --> means telling react how a component should look like based on the current state/data.
- JSX:- syntax that combine HTML,CSS and JS as well as referencing other components. 
- state-drive: react reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI. 
- react is a just a library not a framework

                Display& Manage        (React bulid up on JavaScript)  
                website content        (As React developer. you'll write react-specific JavaScript code)
                and UI
- React uses Js in the bowers to update the page and the UI we see without load the page.

- When writing in React we will define the target UI states - not the steps 
- React = Declarative UI programming.
          (Define the goal not the steps)

- Js is a imperative (define the step not the goal)

- JSX (JavaScript XML)

- React code must be transformed 

        React code        --------------------------------------> code that runs on browser 
   ( JS code typically uses JSX        code is transformed & optimized      (JS without JSX)
        ("HTML in JS"))
